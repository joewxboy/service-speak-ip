## Description

`service-speak-ip` is a lightweight Open Horizon microservice designed to audibly announce the LAN IP address of its host device (such as a Raspberry Pi) every 30 seconds. It uses the `espeak` tool to convert the IP address to speech, making it easy to identify the device's network address without needing a display or SSH access. This service is ideal for IoT and edge computing scenarios where quick, hands-free identification of a device's IP is useful.

It does this over and over forever, every 30 seconds.

Of course, if you wish to hear the speech, you will need to plug in some earphones/headphones or if you have configured your Raspberry Pi to use only the HDMI for audio output, then you will need to connect an HDMI cable to something that can emit audio.

This little example uses the default English `espeak` voice for this (which is pretty horrible), and sends it a text string that looks similar to this:

```
Your eye pee address is 1 9 2 dot 1 6 8 dot 1 dot 1 2 3
```

The `espeak` tool can pronounce many other languages, so hack away if you want that. Here is some documentation:
   [http://espeak.sourceforge.net/docindex.html](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/docindex.html)

By default it only looks at the `eth0` interface. If yu plan to use WiFi then edit the Makefile to specify `wlan0` as the `INTERFACE_NAME`. If deploying wiith Open Horizon, set the `INTERFACE_NAME` as a Service variable.

Of course, specifying the `INTERFACE_NAME` is inconvenient. You could do something better, like determine the hosts's "default route" and then find the host interface that was on that network, and then announce the IP address of that interface. If you did that, then then you would not need to pass any `INTERFACE_NAME` at all. But I was tooo lazy to code that! :-)

This has currently only been tested on a few Raspberry Pi models.

## Prerequisites

- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi (or compatible Linux device) with audio output (headphones, speakers, or HDMI audio)
- **Software:**
  - Docker (for containerized deployment)
  - Python 3
  - `espeak` (speech synthesis)
  - `netifaces` Python package
- **Environment Variables:**
  - `INTERFACE_NAME` (default: `eth0`) â€” The network interface whose IP address will be spoken. Set to `wlan0` for WiFi, or another interface as needed.
